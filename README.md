# the-hero-bundle
Material about software engineering, devops, sql, ml.

## Prerequisites
A working knowledge of the Python programming language as well as its ML stack
If not go to https://github.com/djib2011/python_ml_tutorial

## Road map
The objective of this repository is to bridge the gap between the local / casual use of data science 
and give a glimpse of technologies that are used in industry (Docker, Kubernetes, SQL, Hadoop, Spark, Kafka). 
The repository is organised in Missions. Each Mission assumes some knowledge of the previous missions

- Mission 1: You need to do a fresh start
    - Learn about virtual envs, Docker and pytest
- Mission 2: Eat your queries
    - Learn the basic syntax of SQL
- Mission 3: Eat your queries (part 2)
    - Learn advanced SQL concepts
- Mission 4: Serve it right
    - Take a trained ML model and serve it through a flask app
- Mission 5: Big in data
    - Create a docker cluster, install HDFS and do a Map Reduce job
- Mission 6: A little spark kindles a great fire

- Mission 7: Kafka is a writer, not a fucking platform

- Mission 8: Que te la mongo



There are also some secret missions in order to better understand some ml or data science concepts
- Secret Mission 1: The firm tree does not fear the storm
- Secret Mission 2: In need for support
